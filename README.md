so this is suppose to be similar to the last project in which we used library. However now everything will be done through a database. 
By running the main.py file you will be prompted with choices in the terminal.
These choices will allow you to modify and view uses,authors,and books.
i am missing some functions so its not fully working as planned but it can perform the most basic functions such as adding and viewing. 
p.s after flask week i am sorta understanding and sorta lost on this but will improve on this when i do get the chance!
